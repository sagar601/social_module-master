How to get Social_module up and running

Get Git

The first step is to install Git. Linux and Mac users should have no problems; Windows users might have to install Cygwin first.

Clone of the official repository (git://github.com/jeyboy/social_module.git)
    git clone git://github.com/jeyboy/social_module.git


 * Social_module runs on Ruby on Rails, so first you need to get rails running. Go download rails (http://rubyonrails.org/down) and follow it's instructions to get rails running.
 * The directions in this README file assume some knowledge of rails, but I'll go through it a bit here first.
 * The first thing to do is install the ruby gems that are required. For each gem listed in the README, at the command line, do something like "gem install [gem name]" or "sudo gem install [gem name]".
 * The next thing to do is set up your database . Social_module is setup to use MySQL by default, so just follow the instructions in the README and configure the files for your computer.
 * Now setup global variable (site name and url and stuff) and change the html and css to suit your taste.
 * Start Social_module with the typical "./script/server" and point your browser to "http://localhost:3000&quot;.
